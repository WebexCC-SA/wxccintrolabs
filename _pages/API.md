## Introduction

**Important:** Changes to the API Lab.

- The New Webex Contact Center APIs are now available on **[developer.webex-cx.com](https://developer.webex-cx.com){:target="_blank"}** and use OAuth2 as opposed to One-time API Keys.
- The Legacy APIs (v1) are still available and are documented in the later section of this lab.
- The lab assumes that you will use the All New Webex Contact Center APIs which are documented below.
- For a quick start and overview, refer to the Overview / Quick start section.


## All New Webex Contact Center APIs (New Version)

# Introduction to the New Webex CC APIs
> This is the introduction video. It explains what API we have, what application and authorization mechanisms exist and how to get started.

<iframe width="1024" height="500" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EiCXsxX2EHI?rel=0" title="WxCC Lab #8 Part 1:Introduction to the New Webex Contact Center APIs and Sample Ap" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>




### 1. Walkthrough of Auth Flow 
- To develop applications with the new APIs, you must build an integration with Webex.

- See **[Contact Center Dev Portal Docs](https://developer.webex-cx.com/documentation/getting-started){:target="_blank"}** for all the details. 


Here is a summary: 

**API Access- create an Integration**

- The New  Webex Contact Center APIs are accessed by using Webex OAuth2

- Watch this **[video](https://app.vidcast.io/share/b8b4de22-7322-45d3-ab9c-070b3a8ec1f3){:target="_blank"}** to create an integration and run APIs on postman.

- **[Steps](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/contact-center/webex-contact-center/218418-configure-webex-contact-center-apis-with.html){:target="_blank"}** to create an integration and use on postman 

- OAuth2 by design, requires a client ID, clinet secret, callback URL(Redirect URL)

- Use the Client ID, Client Secret, Redirect URI (callback URL) to obtain access_token for your Org. Use the Access token to hit the API inside of the Authorization header. 

`Authorization: Bearer yourAccessToken`

- Use the refresh_token before it expires to renew your access_token - and get a new set of Access and Refresh Tokens.

`By Default, the access_token is valid for 12 hours and the refresh token is valid for 60 days, however using another call for the refresh token will give you a new set of tokens. Maintaining this access is important for perpetual access. One can write a simple scheduler that performs this background refresh activity.`

**OAuth2 Mechanism - Implications**

- With the OAuth2 support- Will require a "One Time Onboarding" User interface to obtain access to an org

- "Login with Webex" > Button to access an org

- You will register an App with us and use it for N orgs

- Have each Org administrator login into your App at least once to   obtain the tokens

- This is a "Required Onboarding " Process

- Once you obtain an Org's access_token and refresh_token, you can access their data



**OAuth2 Access Token Flow**

- Your App redirects to authorize with Webex (GET)

1. GET `https://webexapis.com/v1/authorize?client_id=______&response_type=code&redirect_uri=_https://your-app/auth___&scope=cjp:config_read&state=set_state_here`

- Admin user COMPLETES login.Redirect back to your App (GET)

2. GET https://your-app/auth?code=___unique_code_sent

-  Your App usess this code - API Endpoint - and then sends a POST request back to Webex

- Request Access Token AND/OR Refresh Tokens (POST)

3. POST https://webexapis.com/v1/access_token`
   application/x-www-form-urlencoded

```javascript
{"access_token":"ZDI3MGEyYzQtNmFlNS00NDNhLWFlNzAtZGVjNjE0MGU1OGZmZWNmZDEwN2ItYTU3",
"expires_in":1209600,
"refresh_token":"MDEyMzQ1Njc4OTAxMjM0NTY3ODkwMTIzNDU2Nzg5MDEyMzQ1Njc4OTEyMzQ1Njc4",
"refresh_token_expires_in":7776000 }
```

> Expiry in seconds and required x-www-form-urlencoded values include

> grant_type = _authorisation_code OR refresh_token_

> client_id

> client_secret

> code

> redirect_uri

### 2. Initial Setup of Sample App

- Login with the POD admin account to https://developer.webex-cx.com/.
